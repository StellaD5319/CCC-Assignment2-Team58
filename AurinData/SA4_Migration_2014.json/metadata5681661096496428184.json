The data uses 2011 ABS ASGS boundaries. <br/>\n\nThe NRP is designed for users interested in the socio-economic and environmental characteristics of regions - and in comparisons with similar geographies across Australia. Data are arranged under the broad themes/topics of Economy, Industry, People, and Energy and Environment. <br/>\n\nPlease note some data are not available for all reference years, for a variety of reasons. For example; there may be conceptual breaks in a data series; the collection frequency may be irregular; some series may have revisions pending; or permission to publish in the NRP may have only been granted recently. In addition, some data series are not available for the full range of geographies. The reasons can include: data owner or custodian preferences; industry identification with a few, particular geographies only; confidentiality protection; and the presence of many suppressed data cells (at smaller geographic levels) thus making true aggregations up to larger ASGS regions difficult. <br/>\n\nThis data is ABS data used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Please note National Regional Profile (1379.0.55.001) has been discontinued.
